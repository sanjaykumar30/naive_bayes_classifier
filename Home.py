ğŸ‘‹ Welcome ! \n
Naive Bayes is a simple technique for constructing classifiers: models that assign class labels
 to problem instances, represented as vectors of feature values, where the class labels are drawn 
 from some finite set.\n
To train the Bayesian model, \n
ğŸ‘‰Upload the Dataset \n
ğŸ‘‰Set the feature and target variables\n
ğŸ‘‰Set the testing dataset ratio\n
ğŸ‘‰Download the final predicted output\n

**Note**: The input dataset should not contain any Null values and should not require any transformations\n.
